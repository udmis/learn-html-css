# Page Layout
The box model is the first step in understanding how the browser lays out HTML elements. Visually appealing websites, however, are often the result of well positioned elements.

In this unit, you'll learn how to position HTML elements in order to gain more control of a web page's layout.

Let's begin!

# Position
Take a look at the block-level elements in the image below:

<img width="336" alt="screen shot 2017-09-19 at 9 56 44 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30623420-7fd619b6-9d85-11e7-996f-e38b011b07ba.png">

The boxes in the image above were created with the following CSS:

```
.boxes {
  width: 120px;
  height: 70px;
}
```

Notice the block-level elements in the image above take up their own line of space and therefore don't overlap each other. In the browser to the right you can see block-level elements also consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the default *position* for block-level elements.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its `position` property. The `position` property can take one of four values:

1. `static` - the default value (it does not need to be specified)

2. `relative`

3. `absolute`

4. `fixed`

In the next few exercises, you'll learn about the values in items 2, 3, and 4 above. For now, it's important to understand that if you favor the default position of an HTML element, you don't need to set its `position` property.

# Position: Relative
One way to modify the default position of an element is by setting its `position` property to `relative`.

This value allows you to position an element `relative` to its default static position on the web page.

```
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
}
```

Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page.

```
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the div has been positioned using two of the four `offset properties`. The valid offset properties are:

1. `top` - moves the element down.

2. `bottom` - moves the element up.

3. `left` - moves the element right.

4. `right` - moves the element left.

In the example above, the div will be moved down 20 pixels and to the right 50 pixels from its default static position. The image below displays the new position of the box. The dotted line represents where the statically positioned (default) box was positioned.

<img width="336" alt="screen shot 2017-09-19 at 10 04 14 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30623588-83d834c6-9d86-11e7-82e1-d224e36a2698.png">

Units for offset properties can be specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. Note that offset properties will not work if the position of the element is not set to `relative`.

#Position: Absolute
Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to `absolute`.

When an element's position is set to `absolute` all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page.

```
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the `.box-bottom` div will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren't specified, the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box. Take a look at the gif below:

<img width="1308" alt="video1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30623758-b10340c0-9d87-11e7-8b3e-8db7a337a477.png">

The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

In the next exercise we will compare the scrolling of `absolute` elements with `fixed` elements.

# Position: Fixed
When an element's position is set to `absolute`, as in the last exercise, the element will scroll out of view when a user scrolls.

We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to `fixed`.

```
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the div will remain fixed to its position no matter where the user scrolls on the page, like in the image below:

This technique is often used for navigation bars on a web page.

<img width="1308" alt="video2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30623915-7fc28128-9d88-11e7-9d0c-9fc946fb9597.png">

# Z-Index
When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes (and therefore, their content) can overlap with each other, making the content difficult to read or consume.

```
.box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the `.box-bottom` div ignores the `.box-top` div and overlaps it as a user scrolls.

The `z-index` property controls how far "back" or how far "forward" an element should appear on the web page.

The `z-index` property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be displayed on the web page.

```
.box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

In the example above, we set the `.box-top` position to relative and the z-index to 2. We changed position to `relative`, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of `2` moves the `.box-top` element forward, because it is greater than the `.box-bottom` z-index, `1`. See the example image below:

<img width="331" alt="screen shot 2017-09-19 at 10 25 51 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30624104-8a96a9de-9d89-11e7-923a-cdf9733cfbcb.png">

In the image above, you can see the top box is moved in front of the bottom box.

# Float
So far, you've learned how to specify the exact position of an element using offset properties. If you're simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the `float` property.

The `float` property can be set to one of two values:

1. `left` - this value will move, or float, elements as far left as possible.

2. `right` - this value will move elements as far right as possible.

```
.boxes {
    width: 120px;
    height: 70px;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  float: right;
}
```

In the example above, we float the `.box-bottom` element to the `right`. This works for static and relative positioned elements. See the result of the code below:

<img width="329" alt="screen shot 2017-09-19 at 10 29 12 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22403086/30624194-fc7b51bc-9d89-11e7-9ab0-2d582def986d.png">

Floated elements must have a width specified, as in the example above. Otherwise, the element will assume the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.

# Clear
The `float` property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can "bump" into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.

The `clear` property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:

1. `left` — the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.

2. `right` — the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.

3. `both` — neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.

4. `none` — the element can touch either side.

```
div {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
}

div.special {
  clear: left;
}
```

In the example above, all divs on the page are floated to the left side. The div with class `special` did not move all the way to the left because a taller div blocked its positioning. By setting its `clear` property to `left`, the `special` div will be moved all the way to the left side of the page.

#Review: Layout
Great job! In this lesson, you learned how to control the positioning of elements on a web page.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

1. The `position` property allows you to specify the position of an element in three different ways.

2. When set to `relative`, an element's position is relative to its default position on the page.

3. When set to `absolute`, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move out of view when the page is scrolled.

4. When set to `fixed`, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.

5. The `z-index` of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page.

6. The `float` property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.

7. You can clear an element's left or right side (or both) using the `clear` property.

When combined with an understanding of the box model, positioning can create visually appealing web pages. So far, we've focused on adding content in the form of text to a web page. In the next unit, you'll learn how to add and manipulate images to a web page.
